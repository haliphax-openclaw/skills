# Deep Linking — `openclaw://` URLs

The canvas web server supports `openclaw://` deep links that allow rendered canvas content to trigger agent runs. This creates a feedback loop where agents can build interactive UIs with actionable links.

## How It Works

1. An agent pushes HTML content to the canvas (via file-served HTML or `data:` URLs)
2. The server injects a script into served HTML that intercepts clicks on `openclaw://` links
3. The SPA surfaces a confirmation dialog showing the message and options
4. On confirmation, the request is proxied to the gateway's `/tools/invoke` endpoint
5. The gateway spawns an isolated subagent session via `sessions_spawn`

## URL Schemes

Three custom URL schemes are supported:

| Scheme | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `openclaw://` | Agent deep links | `openclaw://agent?message=Run+the+tests` |
| `openclaw-fileprompt://` | File-based subagent spawn | `openclaw-fileprompt://jsonl/task.md?agentId=dev` |
| `openclaw-canvas://` | Session file references | `openclaw-canvas://my-project/logo.png` |

Canonical copy: [openclaw-canvas-web `docs/deep-linking.md`](https://github.com/haliphax-openclaw/openclaw-canvas-web/blob/main/docs/deep-linking.md). The canvas SPA uses `parseOpenClawUrl()` (see repo `src/client/utils/url-schemes.ts`).

### `openclaw://` — Agent Deep Links

```
openclaw://agent?message=<text>&sessionKey=<key>&agentId=<id>&model=<model>&thinking=<mode>
```

```
openclaw://agent?message=Run+the+tests
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `message` | Yes | The message to send to the agent |
| `agentId` | No | Target agent ID (uses default if omitted) |
| `model` | No | Model override (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `sessionKey` | No | Parent session key for completion announcements. Defaults to `"devnull"` (suppresses announcements). Set to a real session key to receive completion events. |
| `thinking` | No | Thinking mode: `on`, `off`, or `stream` |
| `deliver` | No | Delivery mode for the response |
| `to` | No | Delivery target |
| `channel` | No | Delivery channel |
| `timeoutSeconds` | No | Timeout for the agent run |
| `key` | No | Authentication key |

## Confirmation Dialog

When a user clicks an `openclaw://` link, a confirmation dialog appears showing:

- The message that will be sent to the agent (truncated to 300 characters)
- An expandable "Options" section with:
  - Agent selector (populated from the canvas config's agent list)
  - Model override text input
  - Thinking mode selector (default/on/off/stream)
  - Session key override

The user must click "Send" to execute the deep link. Clicking "Cancel" or the overlay dismisses it.

### Skipping Confirmation

The confirmation dialog can be disabled via the canvas config endpoint (`/api/canvas-config`) by setting `skipConfirmation: true`. Use with caution — this allows any rendered canvas content to trigger agent runs without user approval.

## Script Injection

The server automatically injects a deep link handler script into HTML content served through the canvas file routes (`/_c/:session/*`). The injected script:

1. Listens for click events on `<a>` elements with `href` starting with `openclaw://`
2. Prevents the default navigation
3. Sends a `postMessage` to the parent SPA frame with the URL
4. The SPA's CanvasView receives the message and shows the confirmation dialog

This works for both file-served HTML and inline content. For `data:` URLs, the script is injected into the iframe's content document.

## Example: Interactive Dashboard

An agent can build a dashboard with actionable links:

```html
<h2>Failing CI Checks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    openclaw-tools-mcp-server — test workflow
    <a href="openclaw://agent?message=Fix+the+failing+test+in+openclaw-tools-mcp-server">Fix this</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    skills — validate workflow
    <a href="openclaw://agent?message=Fix+the+schema+validation+in+the+skills+repo">Fix this</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

When the user clicks "Fix this", the confirmation dialog appears, and on approval, the agent receives the message and can act on it.

## File-Based Subagent Spawn — `openclaw-fileprompt://` URLs

The `openclaw-fileprompt://` scheme spawns a subagent whose **task** is the **full text** of a file on the canvas host. The canvas server's `/api/file-spawn` endpoint reads that file and passes its contents to `sessions_spawn` via the gateway's `/tools/invoke` endpoint (same tool as `openclaw://`).

### URL format

```
openclaw-fileprompt://<path>?agentId=<id>&model=<model>&sessionKey=<key>
```

**`<path>` is not a query parameter.** It is the URL path immediately after `openclaw-fileprompt://` (everything before `?`). For example, to load `jsonl/instructions.md` under the resolved root below, use:

```
openclaw-fileprompt://jsonl/instructions.md?agentId=developer
```

The SPA parses this into `{ path: "jsonl/instructions.md", params: { agentId: "developer", ... } }` and POSTs to `/api/file-spawn` with JSON `{ "file": "jsonl/instructions.md", "agentId": "developer", ... }`. The JSON field is named `file` for historical reasons; it is **always** populated from the URL path, not from `?file=`.

### Where files are read from

The server resolves the file with `path.resolve(root, <path>)` where `root` is:

1. **If `agentId` is set and matches an agent in `openclaw.json`:**  
   `<that agent's workspace>/canvas`  
   (e.g. `~/.openclaw/workspaces/developer/canvas` for agent `developer`).
2. **Otherwise:** `OPENCLAW_CANVAS_ROOT` (default `~/.openclaw/workspace/canvas`).

So prompts are read from the agent's **`canvas/`** directory (often `canvas/jsonl/...`), not from the full agent workspace above `canvas/`. Path traversal outside `root` is rejected.

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `agentId` | No | Selects which agent's `…/workspace/.../canvas` directory is used to resolve `<path>` when the agent is registered. |
| `model` | No | Model override forwarded to `sessions_spawn`. |
| `sessionKey` | No | Same as `openclaw://`: target session for completion announcements. Omitted → `"devnull"` (see below). |

There is **no** `workspace` query parameter on the canvas server; cwd/workspace for the **child** run is determined by the gateway's `sessions_spawn`, not by `/api/file-spawn`.

### Example (HTML)

```html
<a href="openclaw-fileprompt://jsonl/deploy-notes.md?agentId=developer">Deploy</a>
```

## API Proxy

Deep link execution is proxied through the canvas server's `/api/agent` endpoint, which calls the gateway's `/tools/invoke` endpoint to spawn an isolated subagent session via `sessions_spawn`. This avoids the hooks security boundary, which injects warning text into the agent's prompt.

```
Client → POST /api/agent { message, agentId, model?, sessionKey?, ... }
       → Gateway /tools/invoke (sessions_spawn)
       → Isolated subagent run triggered

Client → POST /api/file-spawn { file: "<path from URL>", agentId?, model?, sessionKey?, ... }
       → Read file under <agent>/canvas or CANVAS_ROOT
       → Gateway /tools/invoke (sessions_spawn)
       → Subagent run triggered with file contents as task
```

### Suppressing Completion Announcements

By default, `sessions_spawn` auto-announces completion back to the parent session, which costs tokens. **Both** `/api/agent` and `/api/file-spawn` set `sessionKey` to `"devnull"` when it is omitted — a nonexistent session that silently drops the announcement.

To route the completion to a specific session instead (e.g., for monitoring), pass `sessionKey` in the URL query string for **either** scheme:

```
openclaw://agent?message=Refresh+data&agentId=developer&sessionKey=agent:developer:discord:channel:123
```

```
openclaw-fileprompt://jsonl/task.md?agentId=developer&sessionKey=agent:developer:discord:channel:123
```

If `sessionKey` is omitted, it defaults to `"devnull"` (no announcement).

## Canvas Config Endpoint

The `/api/canvas-config` endpoint provides client-side configuration:

```json
{
  "skipConfirmation": false,
  "agents": ["developer", "openclaw-expert", "editor"],
  "allowedAgentIds": ["developer", "openclaw-expert"]
}
```

- `agents` — List of available agent IDs for the confirmation dialog's agent selector
- `allowedAgentIds` — Agent IDs permitted for deep link execution
- `skipConfirmation` — Whether to bypass the confirmation dialog

## A2UI Button Deep Links

A2UI Button components support deep links via the `href` prop. Unlike iframe-based deep links, A2UI buttons POST directly to the appropriate API endpoint without showing a confirmation dialog. This is appropriate for trusted A2UI content where the agent controls the button labels and URLs.

Agent trigger:
```json
{"Button": {"label": "Refresh", "href": "openclaw://agent?message=Refresh+data&agentId=developer"}}
```

File-spawn trigger (path is under that agent's `canvas/` directory):
```json
{"Button": {"label": "Deploy", "href": "openclaw-fileprompt://jsonl/deploy-notes.md?agentId=developer"}}
```

## Gateway Configuration

Agent deep links and file-spawn both use the gateway's `/tools/invoke` endpoint with `sessions_spawn`. The following settings control deep link behavior:

### Agent Deep Links & File Spawn (`/tools/invoke`)

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `gateway.auth.token` | `string` | Bearer token used by the canvas server to authenticate with the gateway. Must match the `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` environment variable (or be readable from `openclaw.json`) |
| `gateway.tools.allow` | `string[]` | Must include `"sessions_spawn"` to permit agent deep links and file-spawn via `/tools/invoke` |

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "your-gateway-token"
    },
    "tools": {
      "allow": ["sessions_spawn", "sessions_send", "sessions_list"]
    }
  }
}
```

Without `gateway.auth.token` and `sessions_spawn` in `gateway.tools.allow`, the canvas server's `/api/agent` and `/api/file-spawn` proxies will receive an authentication failure or 404 from the gateway.

### Disabling the built-in canvas tool

OpenClaw includes a built-in `canvas` tool designed for the desktop app. When using the canvas web server, this tool can cause confusion — agents may attempt to use it instead of `openclaw nodes invoke`, and its `jsonlPath` parameter rejects paths outside the OpenClaw state directory. To prevent this, add `canvas` to the global tool denylist:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "deny": ["canvas"]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All deep links require user confirmation by default (confirmation dialog)
- The `allowedAgentIds` list restricts which agents can be targeted
- Deep links are proxied through the canvas server, not sent directly to the gateway
- The `key` parameter can be used for additional authentication when required
